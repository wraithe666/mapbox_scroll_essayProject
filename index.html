      In this page we are going to see how interactions both positive and negative change as the partition occured as depicted in literary works. On would of course expect partition itself to be the time period with the a lot of negative interactions and pre-partition or long post partition to have more positive interactions.

      Pre-partition is mostly calm with few datapoints of interactions. We do see however that most of our stories are of course centered around the soon to be formed borders of East Pakistan, West Pakistan and India.

      During partition we see quite a few areas of negative interactions especially near the Punjab Border. A large part of the narrative of partition stories focusses on the experiences of characters during the partition. Though fictional these stories are  potrayals of the very real horrors of partition faced by hundreds of thousands of people migrating into their 'new country'<div class=""></div>

      Post partition however sees a large number of position interactions being noted. New Delhi, despite reeling from a major refugee crisis seems to have a lot of positive interactions noted.

      Kingsway Camp, Delhiâ€™s largest refugee camp, was home to about 300, 000 people at its peak. It was so large that families that were separated on the other side of the border would often find each other once they made it to the camp. Kingsway Camp was located where Guru Teg Bahadur or GTB Nagar now stands. (The Nehru Memorial Library)

      After post partition, i.e after 1971-12-16, we see that our texts don't really focus a lot and we see only scattered data points now.

    <p>
      With a topic such as partition we see that even fictional tales serve follow the historical trajectory of events in the partition. It's left a lasting mark on people who've experienced the partition in someway and whether or not these characters are fictional they are analogues of what happened to the people of the Indian Subcontinent.
